          <h3>Cake Decorating</h3>
          <p>I have been decorating cakes since 2005 in the Navy. In 2008, after my tern ended, I enrolled in a cake decorating class and graduated as the only male student at the time. Since then, I have been decorating cakes on and off. My most recent cake was my sisters' wedding cake. Want to see more? <a href="cakes.html">Take a look.</a></p>
